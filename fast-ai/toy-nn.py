"""
    Giga simple "neural network" with one layer, two ReLU neurons.

    Mirrors the fast.ai lecture 3 Titanic excel spreadsheet example.

    Plans:
        1. Read data from titanic csv using pandas
        2. Transform data into ML friendly formats (e.g. encode categorical data, normalize continuous data)
        3. Define mse loss function
        4. Define two sets of weights and biases
        5. Define two ReLU neurons (one for each set of weights and biases)
        6. Train the network on the training data
